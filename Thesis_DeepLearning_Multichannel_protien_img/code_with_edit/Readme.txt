There are thre IPYNB code files:

a) Single_protien_classifi_model : Contains code used to train single channel image using VGG16 and ResNet101v2

1)To run the code load the ipynb file to google collab and the data set to the google drive associted to the same account
2)Run the code to from the first cell to train the model.
3)After training the model save the model weights and follow the inline comments to generate the metrics 
4)Saliency maps can be gerated once the model is trained.

b) VGG_16_multi_channel_model and VGG_19_multi_channel_model : contains code used to tain mutli channel images using VGG16 and VGG19 model respectively

1)To run the code load the ipynb file to google collab and the data set to the google drive associted to the same account
2)Run the code to from the first cell to train the model.
3)After training the model save the model weights and follow the inline comments to generate the metrics 
4)predictions for the 10 channel test numpy arrays can be used to test the model.
